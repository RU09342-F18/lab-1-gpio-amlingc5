In each of the two files are code that will blink multiple LEDs on both the MSP430G2 and the MSP430F5529 at different rates. The delay in each of the codes allows the time between blinks to be changed. 

The MSP430G2553 blinks the LEDs at P1.0 and P1.6. This code uses the msp430.h library. The MSP430F5529 blinks the LEDs at P1.0 and P4.7. This code uses the msp430.h library.
