# Button Blink
September 21, 2018

In each of the two files are code that will blink an LED on each of the MSP430G2 and the MSP430F5529 microcontrollers. 

The MSP430G2553 blinks the LED at P1.0, when the button P1.1 is pressed. This code uses the msp430.h library. The MSP430F5529 blinks the LED at P1.0 when the button P1.3 is pressed. This code uses the msp430.h library.
