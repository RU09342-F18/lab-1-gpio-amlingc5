In each of the two files are code that will blink an LED on both the MSP430G2 and the MSP-EXP432P401R. The delay in each of the codes allows the time between blinks to be changed. These codes are dependent on the MSP430.h library in C.
The MSP430G2553 blinks the LED at P1.0 at a speed of 50000. The MSP-EXP432P401R blinks the LED at P1.0 at a set speed of 100000.
