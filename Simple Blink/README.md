In each of the two files are code that will blink an LED on both the MSP430G2 and the MSP-EXP432P401R. The delay in each of the codes allows the time between blinks to be changed. 

The MSP430G2553 blinks the LED at P1.0. This code uses the MSP430.h library. The MSP-EXP432P401R blinks the LED at P1.0. This code uses the MSP.h library.
